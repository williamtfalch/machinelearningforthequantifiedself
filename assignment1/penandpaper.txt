2.1

When we measure data using sensory devices across multiple users we often see substantial differences
between the sensory values we obtain. Identify at least three potential causes for these differences.

Sensor-related causes:
 - Quality of readings of similar sensors between users
 - Granularity of measurement of sensors

User-related causes:
 - Activity patterns of users
 - Fitness of users
 - Age of users
 - Gender of users

2.2

We have seen that we can make trade-offs in terms of the granularity at which we consider the measurements 
in our basic dataset. We have shown the difference between a granularity of delta_t = 0.25s and delta_t = 60s. We arrived 
at a choice for delta_t = 0.25s for our case, but let us think a bit more general: think of four criteria that play 
a role in deciding on the granularity for the measurements of a dataset.

1) The type of measurement done
2) 
3)
4)

2.3

We have identified two tasks we are going to tackle for the crowdsignals data. Think of at least two other machine learning 
tasks that could be performed on the crowdsignals dataset and argue why they could be relevant to support a user 
(when doing so, keep in mind the different learning approaches discussed in Sect.1.3.2).

3.2

We have seen two types of outlier detection algorithms: distance and distribution based. In what situations would it be better 
to apply a distance based outlier detection algorithm over a distribution-based approach? 

3.4

The local outlier factor algorithm is quite complex. Find out what the computational complexity of the algorithm is 
and discuss ways to improve the scalability of the approach.
